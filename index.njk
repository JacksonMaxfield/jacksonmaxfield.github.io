<p>
  I am a data engineer at <a href="https://numina.co">Numina</a>. Before I started at Numina, I worked as a research engineer at the <a href="https://allencell.org">Allen Institute for Cell Science</a>. You can find most of my work from my time at the Allen Institute under my team's GitHub organzation from when I was there -- <a href="https://github.com/allencellmodeling">AllenCellModeling</a>.<br><br>

  In my free time I lead a team of engineers and designers who work on <a href="https://councildataproject.github.io/seattle">CouncilDataProject</a> -- a generalizable system for municipal government event data processing, archival, search, and, discovery in the hopes of better local government accessiblity and accountability.<br><br>

  You can find my scientific Python, civic technology, and other open-source work on <a href="https://github.com/jacksonmaxfield">GitHub</a>.<br><br>

  You can find my rants and raves about scientific Python, civic technology, other open-source work, and more on <a href="https://twitter.com/jmaxfieldbrown">Twitter</a>.
