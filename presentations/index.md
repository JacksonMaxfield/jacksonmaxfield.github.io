#### Computational Biology

##### AICSImageIO and Large Microscopy Dataset Processing

_Dask Summit 2021_
[https://youtu.be/LNa_gGpSnvc](https://youtu.be/LNa_gGpSnvc)

_How does AICSImageIO attempt to solve problems in image reading and "good" metadata utilzation throughout the computation process. How does it attempt to also solve problems in scaling image analysis to tens-of-thousands images per dataset. This talk will give a brief overview of AICSImageIO in general and then provides a specific example of where it speeds up image processing and encourages users to use metadata as a code legibility tool._
